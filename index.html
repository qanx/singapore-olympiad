        <p>My solution to viral logic problem from April 2015 as reported on <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-3037266/The-maths-problem-set-Singapore-teenagers-left-people-world-stumped.html">The Daily Mail UK</a>. My friend Mark has a complete breakdown of why every possible solution passes or fails <a href="http://mark.github.io/olympiad/">here</a>.</p>

<a id="when-is-cheryls-birthday" class="anchor" href="#when-is-cheryls-birthday" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>When is Cheryl's Birthday?</h2>

<p><em>Albert and Bernard just became friends with Cheryl, and they want to know when her birthday is. Cheryl gives them a list of 10 possible dates.</em></p>

<ul>
<li>May 15, May 16,  May 19</li>
<li>June 17, June 18</li>
<li>July 14, July 16</li>
<li>August 14, August 15, August 17</li>
</ul>

<p><em>Cheryl then tells Albert and Bernard separately the month and the day of her birthday, respectively.</em><br>
<strong><em>Albert:</em></strong> <em>I don't know when Cheryl's birthday is, but I know that Bernard doesn't know either.</em><br>
<strong><em>Bernard:</em></strong> <em>At first I didn't know when Cheryl's birthday is, but now I know.</em><br>
<strong><em>Albert:</em></strong> <em>Now I know when Cheryl's birthday is too.</em></p>

<p>So when is Cheryl's birthday?</p>

<h3>
<a id="knowns" class="anchor" href="#knowns" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Knowns</h3>

<p>Albert: knows month<br>
Bernard: knows day</p>

<p>The dates:</p>

<ul>
<li>May: 15, 16, 19</li>
<li>June: 17, 18</li>
<li>July: 14, 16</li>
<li>August: 14, 15, 17</li>
</ul>

<p>The conversation between Albert and Bernard is the key to the question, so don't discard it!</p>

<h3>
<a id="the-conversation" class="anchor" href="#the-conversation" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>The Conversation</h3>

<p>Properly interpreting the conversation and knowing <strong><em>who</em></strong> is speaking (the one who knows the month or the day) is critical.</p>

<h4>
<a id="albert-speaks-first" class="anchor" href="#albert-speaks-first" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Albert speaks (first)</h4>

<p>Albert: I don't know when Cheryl's birthday is, but I know that Bernard doesn't know either.</p>

<p>What this means: I wasn't given a month that has one of the unique days, so I know Bernard cannot deduce the month from the day he was given at this point.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<strong>May</strong>: 15, 16, <strong>19</strong>
</li>
<li>
<strong>June</strong>: 17, <strong>18</strong>
</li>
<li>July: 14, 16</li>
<li>August: 14, 15, 17</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Elimination</strong> Bold months eliminated, unique days also bolded for visual clarity.</p>

<h4>
<a id="bernard-replies-to-albert-second" class="anchor" href="#bernard-replies-to-albert-second" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Bernard replies to Albert (second)</h4>

<p>Bernard: At first I didn't know when Cheryl's birthday is, but now I know.</p>

<p>What this means: I now know that Albert wasn't given either month with a unique day. I was given a day that is unique in the remaining set, which allows me to deduce the month.</p>

<ul>
<li>July: <strong>14</strong>, 16</li>
<li>August: <strong>14</strong>, 15, 17</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Elimination</strong> The 14th is common to both July and August, so both these dates are eliminated.</p>

<h4>
<a id="albert-replies-to-bernard-third" class="anchor" href="#albert-replies-to-bernard-third" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Albert replies to Bernard (third)</h4>

<p>Albert: Now I know when Cheryl's birthday is too.</p>

<p>What this means: I now know that Bernard was given a day in the remaining set that allowed him to deduce the month. I was given a month that allows me to deduce the day.</p>

<ul>
<li>July: 16</li>
<li>August: 15, 17</li>
</ul>

<p>Since August has two options and July has one, the month he was given must be July. To further clarify: the only way Albert could also deduce the day for the month he was given is if there was only one day for him to choose.</p>
