My friend Mark has a complete breakdown of why every possible solution passes or fails [here](http://mark.github.io/olympiad/).\r\n\r\n## When is Cheryl's Birthday?\r\n\r\n*Albert and Bernard just became friends with Cheryl, and they want to know when her birthday is. Cheryl gives them a list of 10 possible dates.*\r\n\r\n* May 15, May 16,  May 19\r\n* June 17, June 18\r\n* July 14, July 16\r\n* August 14, August 15, August 17\r\n\r\n*Cheryl then tells Albert and Bernard separately the month and the day of her birthday, respectively.*<br />\r\n***Albert:*** *I don't know when Cheryl's birthday is, but I know that Bernard doesn't know either.*<br />\r\n***Bernard:*** *At first I didn't know when Cheryl's birthday is, but now I know.*<br />\r\n***Albert:*** *Now I know when Cheryl's birthday is too.*\r\n\r\nSo when is Cheryl's birthday?\r\n\r\n## How to Solve\r\n\r\n### Knowns\r\n\r\nAlbert: knows month<br />\r\nBernard: knows day\r\n\r\nThe dates:\r\n* May: 15, 16, 19\r\n* June: 17, 18\r\n* July: 14, 16\r\n* August: 14, 15, 17\r\n\r\nThe conversation between Albert and Bernard is the key to the question, so don't discard it!\r\n\r\n### The Conversation\r\n\r\nProperly interpreting the conversation and knowing ***who*** is speaking (the one who knows the month or the day) is critical.\r\n\r\n#### Albert speaks (first)\r\n\r\nAlbert: I don't know when Cheryl's birthday is, but I know that Bernard doesn't know either.\r\n\r\nWhat this means: I wasn't given a month that has one of the unique days, so I know Bernard cannot deduce the month from the day he was given at this point.\r\n\r\n* **May**: 15, 16, **19**\r\n* **June**: 17, **18**\r\n* July: 14, 16\r\n* August: 14, 15, 17\r\n\r\n**Elimination** Bold months eliminated, unique days also bolded for visual clarity.\r\n\r\n#### Bernard replies to Albert (second)\r\n\r\nBernard: At first I didn't know when Cheryl's birthday is, but now I know.\r\n\r\nWhat this means: I now know that Albert wasn't given either month with a unique day. I was given a day that is unique in the remaining set, which allows me to deduce the month.\r\n\r\n* July: **14**, 16\r\n* August: **14**, 15, 17\r\n\r\n**Elimination** The 14th is common to both July and August, so both these dates are eliminated.\r\n\r\n#### Albert replies to Bernard (third)\r\n\r\nAlbert: Now I know when Cheryl's birthday is too.\r\n\r\nWhat this means: I now know that Bernard was given a day in the remaining set that allowed him to deduce the month. I was given a month that allows me to deduce the day.\r\n\r\n* July: 16\r\n* August: 15, 17\r\n\r\nSince August has two options and July has one, the month he was given must be July. To further clarify: the only way Albert could also deduce the day for the month he was given is if there was only one day for him to choose.\r\n\r\n#### Result: July 16th\r\n\r\n#### TL;DR How I solved the problem on a piece of paper\r\n\r\n* Green: Albert first\r\n* Orange: Bernard second\r\n* Blue: Albert third\r\n\r\n![Solution image](solution.png)","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
